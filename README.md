# Christmas Scene

The scene contains several elements, including a background image, snow hills, a Christmas tree, and a cat. Each element has a class called "background", "snow", or "tree-container", respectively, and a data-depth attribute that specifies the depth of the element in the parallax effect.

### Preview: 

<img src="https://github.com/Nalini1998/Christmas-Scene/blob/main/Christmas-scene.PNG" alt="Christmas-Scene" title="Christmas-Scene">

<br>

The background image is displayed twice, once as the left background and once as the right background, to create a seamless background effect. The snow hills are displayed both in front and behind the tree to create a 3D effect.
